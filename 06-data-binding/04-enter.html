                        // Since our array has six elements, the code after this will run six times for every element in the array.

            .enter() // The enter() function checks for <span> elements corresponding to our five array elements.
                     // Since it does not find any, it will create a span for each of the five elements.

            .append("span") // And this will append above created spans to the body element.

                                 // from the data array as text to each of our span selections and
                                 // prints them onto the screen!
